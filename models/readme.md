**The models that i have created are based on the approach for making a Deep Learning Model which deals with mutli isntance image classification as in the dataset selected we had 36 classes of images:-**

Here are the classes present in the ASL Dataset, formatted in a table for better readability:

| Classes |
|---------|
| A       |
| B       |
| C       |
| D       |
| E       |
| F       |
| G       |
| H       |
| I       |
| J       |
| K       |
| L       |
| M       |
| N       |
| O       |
| P       |
| Q       |
| R       |
| S       |
| T       |
| U       |
| V       |
| W       |
| X       |
| Y       |
| Z       |
| 0       |
| 1       |
| 2       |
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
| 6       |
| 7       |
| 8       |
| 9       |

These classes represent the hand gestures corresponding to the English alphabets (A-Z) and numbers (0-9) in American Sign Language.

## Important note:-
**for all the three models that i have created, the parts excluding the model architecture and its definition are mostly the same for the accuracy result to be based out on the same parameters.**


# Approach for Multi-Instance Image Classification

**1. Importing important libaries**

**2. Loading the datasets and creating image and label list for each category** 

**3. Division of train test ad split of the dataset**

**4. Data preprocessing and Image data generators**

**5. Division for images in training , testing and validation categories**

**6. Making of the models**
